			Tells Sentinel to monitor this master, and to consider it in O_DOWN
			(Objectively Down) state only if at least quorum sentinels agree.

			Note that whatever is the ODOWN quorum, a Sentinel will require to
			be elected by the majority of the known Sentinels in order to
			start a failover, so no failover can be performed in minority.

			Note: master name should not include special characters or spaces.
			The valid charset is A_z 0_9 and the three characters ".__".

			Number of milliseconds the master (or any attached slave or sentinel) should
			be unreachable (as in, not acceptable reply to PING, continuously, for the
			specified period) in order to consider it in S_DOWN state (Subjectively
			Down).

			Default is 30 seconds.

			How many slaves we can reconfigure to point to the new slave simultaneously
			during the failover. Use a low number if you use the slaves to serve query
			to avoid that all the slaves will be unreachable at about the same
			time while performing the synchronization with the master.
